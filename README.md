This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

##Steps :

npm install

npm start


Working of application:
The table in the app has a list of users with view button for each.
These users are being fetched from json locally.
Clicking on the view button opens a modal.
This modal has a list of activity periods for the user on that day.
However by changing the date activity periods will change.
Clearing the date will show activity periods of the user for all dates.
